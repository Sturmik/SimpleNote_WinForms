This is simple application for user to create events. To be more straightforward it is notification app.

Main functions are:
- Creating a notification.
  * You can give name for it
  * Set up date when it should notify you
  * Time to notify                                                      ! You can't set up date or time in the past !  
  * Set up text color and background of your notification
  * Set up music for notify, you can upload your own or choose from previous uploaded ones
- Delete existing notify
- Search for existing notify
- Delete all irrelevant notifications

The main purpose of the app is to allow user to set
up alarms for specific time in the future to not miss important events.

If user closes the app, it won't be able to inform him/her about specific events, however when user will open the app
again it will show every single one of missed events.
